## Overview

- Importing the open-sourced Sakila Database to Python.
- Importing the desired Pandas dataframe. Setting the index and parsing 
dates for better data handling.
- Exploring the dataframe.
- Data cleaning to drop any `null` values, if deemed desirable. 
- Exploratory analysis of the data:
    - Mean of the `rental_duration`.
    - Most common `rental_rate`.
    - Distribution of the `replacement_cost` associated with the films.
    - Number of films per rating, and their associated `replacement_cost`.
    - Creation of a calculated column `rental_days`, that will show the rental duration in days.
    - Distribution of the `rental_days`.
    - Various analysis of the `daily_rental_rate` (e.g. highest `daily_rental_rate`, 
    list of films with the lowest `daily_rental_rate`, etc.)
    - Various analysis of rentals in different cities.
